This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate basic Pandas methods and attributes.

## Contents

* **11 Must-Know Pandas String Functions.ipynb:**
    * This notebook provides examples of essential Pandas string functions, including:
        * `str.lower()` and `str.upper()`: Convert strings to lowercase or uppercase.
        * `str.len()`: Calculate the length of strings.
        * `str.strip()`, `str.lstrip()`, and `str.rstrip()`: Remove leading/trailing or only leading/trailing whitespace.
        * `str.split()`: Split strings into multiple columns based on a delimiter.
        * `str.contains()`: Filter rows based on substring presence.
        * `str.replace()`: Replace specific substrings within strings.
        * `str.startswith()` and `str.endswith()`: Check if strings start or end with particular substrings.
        * `str.cat()`: Concatenate strings from different columns.
        * `str.get()`: Access specific characters or elements within strings.
        * `str.slice()`: Extract substrings based on start and stop indices.
        * `str.find()` and `str.rfind()`: Find the index of the first or last occurrence of a substring.
     
         
* **Warm_up_exercises.ipynb:**
    * Provides a series of introductory exercises to familiarize yourself with core Pandas operations, including:
        * Creating DataFrames from dictionaries.
        * Viewing and inspecting data (head, tail, shape, info).
        * Handling missing values.
        * Calculating summary statistics.
        * Working with unique values.
        * Filtering and selecting data based on conditions.
        * Applying functions and transformations to columns.
        * Mapping values between columns.
        * Dropping columns.
        * Sorting DataFrames.


* **Ecommerce Purchases.ipynb:**
    * This notebook analyzes an E-commerce dataset, showcasing various data exploration and analysis techniques:
        * Displaying the top and bottom rows of the dataset.
        * Checking data types and handling missing values.
        * Getting information about the dataset (columns, number of rows, etc.).
        * Calculating summary statistics like maximum, minimum, and average purchase prices.
        * Filtering and counting rows based on specific criteria (e.g., language, job title, credit card provider).
        * Extracting information from specific rows based on conditions (e.g., IP address, credit card number).
        * Analyzing purchase patterns (e.g., AM vs. PM purchases, credit card expiration dates).
        * Identifying the most popular email providers.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries (`pandas`).
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the code examples and analysis.

## Learning Objectives

* Gain familiarity with fundamental Pandas string manipulation functions.
* Understand how to apply Pandas for data cleaning, exploration, and basic analysis.
* Learn how to filter, aggregate, and transform data using Pandas.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code to enhance your understanding of Pandas and its applications in data analysis.

**Happy coding!**
